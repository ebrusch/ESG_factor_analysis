# ESG factor analysis

### Master thesis project

This is code for my thesis which investigates ESG scores and risk/return through Fama & French and Carhart factor models. 

The code pulls the factors directly from Fama & French's website, however the stock information is proprietary of Copenhagen Business School
hence not included.
